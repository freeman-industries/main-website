				LeSalon

			<p>
				This on-demand service lets you book manicures and pedicures by trained professionals in the comfort of your own home.
			</p>

			<p>
				We designed and implemented a new booking process, where we aimed to eliminate confusion and save users time at every stage in the booking.
			</p>

			<p>
				As a fast-moving startup, LeSalon had also accrued a lot of technical debt that we helped them eliminate from their Meteor app.
