				Papertrail for Web
			</h1>

			<p>
				Papertrail is a SaaS app that makes it easy for companies to keep track of their mandatory equipment inspections. 
			</p>

			<p>
				We successfully implemented a redesign of their web app over a two-month period, and the app has been handed over to and iterated upon many times since then by their in-house dev team.
