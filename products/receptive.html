				Receptive

			<p>
				Receptive makes it easy to get product feedback from your users, and then tells you what features to build next into your app.
			</p>

			<p>
				We gave the whole app a lick of paint to take it from MVP to polished product. The team were very pleased with the new look!
			</p>

			<p>
				If you run a SaaS app with paying customers, this product is for you.
